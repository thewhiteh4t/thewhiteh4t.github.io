## Introduction

Seeker works on the concept of social engineering we all know as phishing. Instead of credentials you can use seeker to phish for geolocation. Follow the step by step instructions provided below to install seeker on termux.

## Step 1 - Update

Update and upgrade termux packages :

```bash
pkg update
pkg upgrade
```

if you are getting any errors after running the `update` command then you can easily fix it using a neat in-built termux utility : `termux-change-repo`, just run the command and it will ask you to choose nearby region for termux package repositories, any package related errors should go away at this point.

## Step 2 - Install git

We will be downloading seeker from GitHub. To do that we will use `git` command, you can read and learn more about [git command here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git). Using the `pkg` command we can install `git` :

```bash
pkg install git
```

## Step 3 - Download seeker

Download seeker from GitHub, make sure to download the official version as there are many old and outdated forks available :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/seeker.git
cd seeker/
```

## Step 4 - Permissions

Earlier there was a separate termux install script but now there is a single install script for simplicity. Using `chmod` command give the script execution permissions. You can read and learn more about [chmod command here](https://cets.seas.upenn.edu/answers/chmod.html).

```bash
ls
chmod +x install.sh
```

## Step 5 - Install

Now we are ready to install all required dependencies for seeker and the install script will automate that for us.

```bash
./install.sh
```

As you can see, for each dependency the script will show the status, do not panic if it looks stuck, the script is installing the packages in background.

But lets say you get an error in any of the packages, check out the last line, an `install.log` file has been created! We can simply read the logs and look for any errors. After looking for the error on google/chatgpt/<insert your favorite LLM>, try to fix the error and then repeat `step 5` again, i.e. run the install script again, if the errors were fixed you will see `Installed` for each dependency.

This is very important because without all dependencies seeker will not run properly. Below you can see what my `install.log` file looks like :

## Step 6 - Launch

The best part, now we can simply run seeker using the `python` command :

```bash
python seeker.py
```

If you have multiple versions of `python` installed then make sure to use `python3` since seeker supports `python3` and above.

## Step 7 - Secure Tunnels

Seeker requires `HTTPS` . This is compulsory because geolocation features can only accessed in a secure context. There are no bypasses for this. Now you have different options for this step depending on what you choose. For example you can host seeker on a VPS with nginx reverse proxy and a SSL certificate.

But since we are using the tool on termux, easiest option is a secure tunneling application like `ngrok`. You can find lots of tutorials and videos on how to download and use ngrok on termux so I won't be covering that in this post. There are many other alternatives available as well, check out [Awesome Tunneling on GitHub](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling).

You will need a second termux session or in simple words a second terminal window where you can launch a secure tunnel. You need to swipe from the left edge to open the sessions panel as shown :

Usually these secure tunnels provide a secure `HTTPS` URL, make sure to forward the correct port! By default seeker uses port `8080` but you can easily change this using `-p` or `--port` option as shown below :

```bash
python seeker.py --port 9000
```

and forward the same port in your tunnel, for example if you are using ngrok you can use the following command :

```bash
ngrok http 9000
```
