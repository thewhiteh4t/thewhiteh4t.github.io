There are many ways by which you can activate Windows 10, most of them involve usage of third party applications, they work but the problem is obtaining a clean, malware free copy of these software, specially for new users. We also know that evading an anti malware service is not that hard so the best way to protect yourself from these software packed with malware is to not use them whenever it is possible. So I am providing step-by-step instructions on how to activate windows 10 without any 3rd party software using `KMS`. These step can be used to activate any build of windows 10. If you have a laptop that comes with windows pre-installed then it can be a bit problematic as they store OEM license key in the BIOS. This process may not work directly in such cases.

## What is KMS?

The Key Management Service (KMS) is an activation service that allows organizations to activate systems within their own network, eliminating the need for individual computers to connect to Microsoft for product activation. It does not require a dedicated system and can be easily co-hosted on a system that provides other services.

## What is a KMS Host Key?

A KMS Key is used to activate the KMS host computer with a Microsoft activation server and can activate up to six KMS hosts with 10 activations per host. Each KMS host can activate an unlimited number of computers.

To activate windows 10 open CMD / Powershell / Windows Terminal with Administrator Privileges and follow the steps below :

## Step 1

Step 1 requires a KMS Key which are available here : [KMS Client Setup Keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys)

These keys can be used multiple times on multiple systems.

```
Operating system edition		KMS Client Setup Key

```

Now Execute the command below and replace x with the key of your choice

```
slmgr /ipk ххххх-ххххх–ххххх–ххххх–ххххх
```

## Step 2

Now we want to use a KMS Server from where our windows will be activated, there are some servers available.

```

Now Execute the command below and replace the server of your choice

Note : Some servers may not be working, so try another one if it fails at this step, I might add more servers in future.

```markdown
slmgr /skms [serverhere]:1688
```

## Step 3

Final Step is to execute the command below to activate your Windows 10

```
slmgr /ato
```
